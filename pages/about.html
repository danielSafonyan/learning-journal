            <h3 class="article-subhead">Hi there! My name is Daniel and welcome to my learning journal.</h3>
            <p class="article-par">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to
            get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers..</p>
            <h3 class="article-subhead">How I Got Started</h3>
            <p class="article-par">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with
            the world.</p>
            <p class="article-par">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each
            learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I
            learned using my own words.</p>
            <h3 class="article-subhead">How I stay Commited.</h3>
            <p class="article-par">That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn
            and stay motivated.</p>
